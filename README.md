# PyBer_Analysis
## Module 5
### Proyect Overview

Being a new employee as a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, I just received the work assignment of a lifetime: analize the rideshare data from January to the end of April of 2019, in order to create visualizations of this data for the CEO, V.Isualize.

Therefore, the objective of this assignment will be to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine the affordability for underserved areas. So we receive a good advice from a partner as well: for the presentation of this analysis to the CEO, we will need to answer as far as possible, the questions that she may have, before she has the chance to ask them; and at the end we would be able to give more business recommendations to the CEO.
